In this section, focus is on the playable character & Game Engine

  - ~~Use mouse to aim~~
  - ~~Use keyboard to move~~

3D models can now be imported in the game.
A packaging format has been developed for this and a tool has been written to packages files

Started to think about Windows port
- The code should compile
- The preferred renderer should be Direct3D (OpenGL should be allowed)
